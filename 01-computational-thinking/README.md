# Q1. What's the largest decimal number that you can represent with 5 bits?
**A:** 31

# Q2. How is "bucketizing" relevant to problem solving in computer science?
**A:** Bucketizing helps in problem solving by grouping similar data or breaking complex problems into smaller, more manageable categories.

# Q3. How to represent positive, negative numbers, and zero in binary?
**A:**  
We can use **two's complement** representation.  
Example:  
- `0101 = +5`  
- `1011 = -5`  
- `0000 = 0`  

The leftmost bit (MSB) shows whether the number is positive or negative.

# Q4. 84 104 101 32 97 110 115 119 101 114 32 105 115 32 53 48 33  
**A:** The answer is **50!**

# Q5. Write an algorithm (15–50 steps) for something you do every day.
**A:** Example – Making tea:
1. Go to the kitchen.  
2. Take a kettle.  
3. Fill it with water.  
4. Put kettle on the stove.  
...  
(continue up to ~20 steps)

# Q6. Why is it not possible to sort n elements in fewer than n steps?
**A:**  
Because the algorithm must **look at each element at least once** to know its value. Without checking each one, sorting is impossible.

# Q7. What is abstraction in computer science?
**A:**  
Abstraction is hiding unnecessary details and focusing only on the essential aspects. It reduces complexity and makes solutions easier to design.

# Q8. Why binary search might not work on a huge list?
**A:**  
Binary search requires the list to be **sorted**. If the list is unsorted, I must first sort it, which may take longer than a linear search.

# Q9. Why use a linked list instead of an array?
**A:**  
When data size is not fixed or changes often. Linked lists allow easy insertion/deletion without shiftin
