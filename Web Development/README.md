## Assignment Questions and Answers

### 1.Even though HTML is, per its own acronym, a language, why would it be incorrect to call HTML a programming language?
We can't call HTML a programming language because it doesn't actually do anything. It only tells the browser, "This is a header, this is a paragraph, this is an image.
" It has no conditions, loops, or calculations.

### 2. In your own words, what is the action attribute of an HTML form used for?
The action attribute of an HTML form tells the browser where to send the data when the user submits the form. It’s basically the URL of the server or script that will handle
 the information the user typed in. Without it, the form doesn’t know where to go.

### 3. What is a CSS selector?
A CSS selector is just a way to pick which HTML elements we want to style. It tells the browser, apply these styles to this part of the page. For example, you can select all <p> tags, 
a specific element with an ID, or elements with a certain class.

### 4. Where would we see a file named "favicon.ico"?
You usually see the favicon.ico as the small icon in the browser tab next to the page’s title, or sometimes in our bookmarks or favorites list.

### 5. In what context might we use the DOM?
We use the DOM when we want to access or change a web page with JavaScript, like getting what a user typed in a form, updating text or images, or adding new elements without reloading the page.

## Reflection

During this project, I built a multi-page website using HTML and CSS on Replit. I learned how to structure multiple pages, link them together, and style elements with an external stylesheet.
I also practiced using forms and the action attribute, CSS selectors, and gained a better understanding of how the DOM can be used to dynamically manipulate web content.
Working on this project helped me understand the workflow of creating a website from scratch, testing it in an online IDE, and troubleshooting issues to ensure everything works correctly. 
The process strengthened my confidence in basic web development.
At the end, I tested my website, and the site runs without errors with all CSS styles properly applied — the output is as expected.
